Deletes ALL transients from ALL sites in a Multisite.

== Description ==

This plugin is a Multisite plugin. It can be activated only in network wide. The Surbma - Multisite Transient Cleaner plugin deletes ALL transients from ALL sites in a Multisite. So please be careful and don't forget to backup your database before acivating this plugin!

The transient deletion only runs once, when the plugin is activated. You can leave it as is, but I strongly recommend to deactivate it and activate again, if you need so.

I don't recommend this plugin for anybody and I don't promise anything, this plugin can solve, it is doing, what it says: deletes ALL transients from ALL sites in a Multisite. If you need a simple way to do just this, this plugin will do the job.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `surbma-multisite-transient-cleaner` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Surbma - Multisite Transient Cleaner plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a transient? =

Please read the official WordPress Codex here: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API" target="_blank">Transients API »</a>

= Is this plugin for me? =

If you have this question in your mind, it is probably not for you. This plugin is for Multisite Network managers, who know what it is good for. If you choose to use this plugin, don't forget to backup your database!

= Can I schedule it? =

No. The transient cleaning function only runs, when you activate the plugin. If you leave it activated, it will do nothing at all. You have to deactivate and activate again to make a new transient cleaning in your database. Don't forget to backup your database, before you activate the plugin!

= What does Surbma mean? =

It is the reverse version of my last name. ;)
